The Government sold 10%, 10% and 25% in 1990,1996 and 1998 respectively, reducing its shareholding to 35%<\/p>\\n<br>\\n<p>4. A series of rights issues in 2004, 2008 and 2010 were conducted by the company, with proceeds channeled towards growing the business and financing regional expansion. The Government opted not to take up its rights effectively diluting its ownership to 26.2%, 23.6% and 17.3% respectively<\/p>\\n<br>\\n<p>5.
