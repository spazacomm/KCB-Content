The middleman uses the back-to-back LC subtype which involves the issuance of 2 separate LCs namely:<\/li>\\n        \\nThe master LC issued in favour of the middleman by the final buyer\u2019s bank.\\n\\nThe back-to-back (or slave LC) issued in favour of the ultimate supplier.\\n\\nThe terms and conditions of the back-to-back LC mirror those of the master LC with the exception of the LC amount, unit price, LC expiry date, latest shipment date and presentation period. The payment proceeds derived from the master LC are used to settle payments owed to the ultimate supplier, the residual balance of the master LC proceeds being the profit margin for the middleman.\\n\\t\\t<li><b>Transferable:<\/b> Where so designated, the first beneficiary of a transferable LC has the right to request the named transferring bank to make the LC available to one or more parties and can be transferred in whole or in part to second beneficiaries, but only once, provided that partial drawings or shipments are permitted. <\/li> \\n\\t<li><b>Assigned L\/C<\/b>- If a credit is not transferable, an assignment is another option available to a beneficiary to finance their purchase of goods from their supplier. With assignment of proceeds the beneficiary can instruct the nominated bank to assign partially or in total the proceeds available under the LC to a third party (assignee). The assignee is not a party to the LC and is not entitled to any proceeds unless the nominated bank acknowledges the assignment and the beneficiary has presented fully complying documents.<\/li>\\n\\nA transferable LC may only be transferred on same conditions as the original LC except for amount, unit price, expiration date, period after shipping, date for presentation of documents and latest shipping date. A bank is under no obligation to transfer an LC except to the extent and in the manner expressly consented to by that bank. Additionally, unless otherwise agreed at the time of the transfer, all charges incurred in respect of a transfer must be paid by the first beneficiary.\\n\\n<li><b>Revolving:<\/b> Such LCs will contain a condition that permits reinstatement of the LC amount without specific amendments, with the LC revolving either on the basis of value (drawing amount) or on the basis of time for example, on monthly basis.

A demand guarantee serves to substitute the creditworthiness of the Guarantor for that of its customer (the Principal) who applies for issuance of the guarantee in favour of the Beneficiary.\\n\\nA demand guarantee constitutes the Guarantor\u2019s written undertaking to pay a named beneficiary a certain sum of funds upon presentation of specified documents that comply to the terms and conditions of the guarantee, and will contain an expiry date or event by which documents must be presented for honour.\\n\\nGuarantees are similar to LCs in that a guarantee substitutes the issuing Bank\u2019s creditworthiness for that of the Applicant. However, guarantees are generally not used as payment mechanisms and should only be used in the event of default within the underlying commercial obligation. Thus, guarantees should result in payment as a last resort and as such, evidence of default on the part of the Principal is required and should be presented by the named Beneficiary in order to receive payment.\\n\\nGuarantees are issued subject to the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 758.\\n\\nWe offer our customers all types of bank guarantees, both local and international.\\n\\n**Guarantee subtypes include:**\\n\\n<li><b>Bid bond \/ Tender Bond:<\/b><br>\\nIt is issued during the bidding stage of a construction or procurement contract offering.

It is used to alleviate the cost of non-performance during the contract award stage. It is usually 2% to 5% of the value of the bid.<\/li>\\n<li><b>Performance Bond:<\/b><br>\\nIt is an assurance of payment to the beneficiary (the contracting party) in the event that the applicant (the contractor who has signed a contract with the beneficiary) fails to perform fully under the contract. It is typically issued after completion of the bidding process, normally during the award stage of a construction or procurement contract offering. It is used to alleviate the cost of non-performance under the contract.<\/li> \\n<li><b>Advance Payment Guarantee (APG):<\/b><br>\\nIt is an assurance of payment to the beneficiary (the buyer who has advanced funds to the supplier or contractor) in the event that the applicant (the supplier or contractor) fails to deliver the necessary materials or meet the defined contractual obligations following receipt of the advance payment. The maximum amount payable under a claim is the amount of advance payment or prepayment.<\/li>\\n<li><b>Financial Guarantee \/ Credit Guarantee:<\/b><br>\\nIt is issued to support an obligor\u2019s creditworthiness where the Applicant takes on credit facilities from the Beneficiary.
